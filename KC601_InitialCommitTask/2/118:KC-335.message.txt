coeus-db/coeus-db-xml/src/main/resources/org/kuali/coeus/coeus-xml/2/AwardDocument.xml

KC-335:REVIEW:Merged - we have some rice object names which may change need to verify once rice is stable

coeus-impl/src/main/resources/edu/hawaii/datadictionary/AwardDocument.xml

KC-503:Keep-Spring Bean Overlay These all need to be tested because there is no merge making it difficult to inspect:
KC-335 Initiator is the only one allowed to submit documents 
KC-503 Award Routing to members of ORS Compliance based on Custom Data field

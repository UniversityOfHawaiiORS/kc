KC-480:Review - I merged but may need to look at 
KC-680 code given new design I think there is better way to do 
KC-480 and it will likely be different in new design.:
KC-328 When adding people to permissions tab Full Name, Unit # and Unit Name say "not found" for valid users 
KC-680 Improve budget finalization (Needs work) 
KC-480 PD - Abstracts and Attachments Tab (Abstracts section): Request for "Project Summary" to be default selection for field
